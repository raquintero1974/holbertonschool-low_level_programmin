# This is the README file for de Searching algorithms project
At the end of this project, one must to be able to explain:

General
What is a search algorithm
What is a linear search
What is a binary search
What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

0-Linear search: function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm.

1-binary.c: a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm.

2-O: the time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n.

4-O:  the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n.

5-O: the space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n

6-O: space complexity of this function / algorithm.
